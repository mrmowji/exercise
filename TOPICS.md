# Topics

Here is the list of topics/concepts which in my opinion will help you with these exercises.

This file is structured in a way you can easily go through, from being a beginner to becoming an expert (hopefully).

Links are provided for completeness. Feel free to follow them to understand a concept better.

## Code

What's code really?

In communications and information processing, **[Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)** is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form or representation, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others.

A specific set of coding, which we need in this context, is **[Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)**.

For the bigger picture, we need to know about **[Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)**.

## Languages

Currently I use JavaScript and TypeScript to solve the problems here.

### JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### TypeScript

TypeScript (TS) is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.

## Tools

I'm a minimalist, or at least I try to be one. In this heavy flow, the first thing that bothers me the most is the bloated software development path.

From time to time, we hear about a new language, tool, etc., but what's the point? The intentions are (or might be) good, the results are not probably. I wrote an article (in Persian/Farsi) regarding [GUI Coding Languages](https://mrmowji.com/why-no-agreement-on-gui-language) from this point of view. The same issue could be generalized to other types of languages.

But hey. We don't live in a perfect world. So here are some tools I use for the purpose of this repository. Some of them seem essential to me. Currently I'm experiencing new ones, so the file will be updated when I find them necessary for a developer's life.

### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

We need some text editor to write our codes. I've used many text editors and IDEs. But in the end, I became a fan of VS Code. It's easy, beautiful, cross-platform, relatively lightweight, and it has one of the best docs to read and learn. Actually VS Code and .NET Core were the main reasons why I abandoned Visual Studio (which is a really heavy IDE for .NET development) and migrated to Ubuntu. Even though it's developed using Electron, but it's much faster than other Electron softwares I've tested (e.g. Postman which I stopped using for good).
