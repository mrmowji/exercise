# Topics

Here is the list of topics/concepts I met through these exercises.

This file is structured in a way you can easily go through, from being a beginner to becoming an expert (hopefully).

Links are provided for completeness. Feel free to follow them to understand a concept better.

## Code

What's code really?

In communications and information processing, **[Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code)** is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form or representation, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they saw, heard, felt, or thought to others.

A specific set of coding, which we need in this context, is **[Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)**.

For the bigger picture, we need to know about **[Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)**.

## Languages

Currently I use JavaScript and TypeScript to solve the problems here.

### JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

### TypeScript

TypeScript (TS) is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.
