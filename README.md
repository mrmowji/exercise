# Exercises

All exercises I've done, from [Exercism](https://exercism.io) and [Edabit](https://edabit.com).

In each directory, you'll find two (or more) solutions; one of them is done by me.

## Setup

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download). NPM will be installed too.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Navigate to the project's directory.
4. Install necessary packages based on what's defined in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

5. To test the codes (`*/me.js`) using [Jest](https://jestjs.io):

```bash
npm run test
```
